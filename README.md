# Employee-Performance-Analysis in SQL
The case study was conducted to determine employee sales analysis to evaluate the performance of individual employees, sales patterns, and regional performance while leveraging **SQL** for analysis to make data-driven decisions based on the results.

## Problem Statement 
To Analyze  the employees'  sales performance  to identify top performers, sales trends over time, regional variations in employees' sales performance, and factors influencing success. 

## Objectives
1. **Employee Performance Metrics:**
   - Who are the top-performing employees based on total sales amount?
   - What is the average sale amount for each employee?
   - Which employees have the highest number of sales transactions?
   - Are there employees with a few high-value sales or many smaller sales?
   - How has the sales performance of individual employees evolved?

2. **Sales Trends Analysis:**
   - What are the overall sales trends over time?
   - Are there specific months or periods with higher sales?
   - How do the sales amounts in USD and EUR compare over time?
 3. **Regional Sales Patterns:**
    - Which regions have the highest total sales in USD and EUR?
    - Are there differences in sales performance across regions?
    - Are certain employees more successful in specific regions?
    - Are there regions that are consistently underperforming?
4. **Sales Conversion Rates:**
   - What is the employee average time between the sale  and  closing date?
    - Are there differences in conversion rates (closing time) between employees?
  
  ## Assumptions
  While conducting the  employee performance analysis, several assumptions were considered:
  + The period for the case study is meaningful and appropriate. Using different periods may yield different results
  + No employee left the organization while the case study was being conducted
  + The sample size is sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions
